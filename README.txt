Design Choices:
For the main program we chose to use no external libraries aside from JUnit for code testing.
We chose to implement option B for part 2.
For the overall design, we made the Bayesian Network using Java because of its robust class system.
We constructed the Bayesian Network as a collection of Nodes and Edges, containing both in respective lists.
Nodes contain the given probabilities, parent edges, and internal logic for probability calculation.
Edges contain a parent and child node.
